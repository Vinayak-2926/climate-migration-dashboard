    ## Climate Migration and the Reshaping of America

    The movement of and survival of human civilization has remained inextricably tied to geography and climate. As technology has evolved, our tolerance for harsh climate conditions has increased, but there are some forces of nature which we have yet to overcome. Wildfires, droughts, flooding, and sweltering heat are climate challenges that continue to impact more Americans with each passing year. By 2070, rising seas could force up to 13 million Americans from their homes, as Abrahm Lustgarten's eye opening 2020 analysis revealed. But this climate-induced migration isn't some distant phenomenon—it's already happening. The First Street Foundation documented over 3.2 million Americans fleeing flood-prone neighborhoods between 2000 and 2020 alone.

    With four out of five Americans already packed into urban centers, climate upheaval isn't just creating migrants—it's also expected to supercharge urbanization. Established metropolitan areas already wrestling with urbanization challenges face critical questions about optimization and sustainability, while smaller cities must develop strategies to accommodate climate refugees seeking safety from escalating environmental threats.
    ### Quantifying the Climate Migration Shuffle

    At the NYU Center for Urban Science + Progress (CUSP), our student research team is taking a deeper look at this emergent issue. We're focused on understanding the dynamic between climate migration and urban preparedness, building upon the research work put forth in Climate Change, Migration, and Regional Economic Impacts in the United States (Fan et al.). This paper analyzed how climate-induced migration would affect the distribution of population across U.S. regions and the results of their research show that climate migration will indeed have tangible effects on the changing distributions of regional population shares by 2065. Specifically, their model shows that climate migration will increase the Northeast's projected population share by 9.11% relative to baseline projections, while decreasing the Midwest's projected share by 4.58% and the South's projected share by 8.07%. The West's projected share is expected to grow by 14.67% compared to baseline, with California specifically seeing its projected share rise by 12.52%.

    ### The Untold Story of Urban Capacity

    While existing literature has largely concentrated on these broad migration patterns, a critical gap remains: there is a lack a detailed analysis of the receiving counties' capacity to absorb these population influxes. Translating these regional shifts to the county level is crucial for understanding the localized impacts of climate migration. Our research team is working in close collaboration with Google Data Commons and TechSoup, leveraging their resources and expertise to examine how a county level of preparedness influences its ability to accommodate climate migrants and ensure equitable outcomes for all.

    ### Scenarios for a Changing America

    To address the research gap, our team at CUSP has taken a scenario-based approach to analyze how different intensities of climate migration might affect U.S. counties. Using the Qin Fan et al. coupled CGE-RUM model projections as our foundation, we've developed multiple climate migration scenarios to provide a varied perspective on the potential future of America. These scenarios vary the magnitude of climate migration's effect on the CGE-RUM model's baseline regional population share projections, which don't endogenize climate migration. We then used these adjusted projections to downscale the Census Population Estimates Program's 2065 national population estimate to the climate region level and finally to the county level. This has allowed us to analyze how various socioeconomic indicators might be affected under different migration intensities, including employment and labor force participation, income levels and distribution, educational attainment and enrollment, housing characteristics, and community safety metrics.

    ### Tools for Understanding

    Our framework incorporates a multi-faceted approach to evaluate counties across multiple dimensions. First, we assess current conditions through time series analysis of key urban systems (2010-2020) to identify existing trends, Z-score analysis to benchmark performance against other counties, and geospatial analysis to measure equity in resource distribution. Building on this foundation, our methodology then projects how climate migration will likely impact each indicator, highlighting which currently stable metrics may deteriorate without intervention and which already struggling systems will face heightened pressure. This approach allows us to identify both emerging vulnerabilities—where currently average-performing counties may fall behind their peers—and exacerbated challenges—where existing deficiencies could reach critical levels due to population influxes. Using the Data Commons Knowledge Graph, our team has efficiently identified and utilized the comprehensive county-level datasets necessary to power this analytical framework and support our data-driven approach.

    ### Predicting the Impact

    Focusing on the impact of climate change-induced migration on counties projected to experience population growth primarily due to climate migration, our research aims to illuminate several critical insights.

    First, we will develop county-level population projections across multiple climate migration scenarios, offering diverse perspectives on potential futures for U.S. counties likely to receive climate migrants. These projections will provide destination counties with essential data to anticipate and strategically prepare for demographic transformations.

    Then, using our analytical framework, we will evaluate urban readiness and resource distribution equity, identifying anticipated deficiencies in vital domains including labor markets, income distribution, housing availability, educational access, public safety, and social support networks. By investigating potential inequities—such as disparate access to employment opportunities, affordable housing, quality education, secure environments, and robust social infrastructures—we seek to generate insights that can help counties prioritize investments and plan effectively for the future, ultimately guiding policies that promote fair and sustainable urban development.

    Building upon these findings, we will formulate policy recommendations for our selected case study area, Erie County. We will examine projected capacity deficits and challenges confronting socially vulnerable populations, striving to put forth policy that will help Erie County to achieve greater preparedness for the imminent realities of climate-induced migration.

    ### Empowering Communities

    Finally, we created the interactive dashboard on this site to allow users to see evaluations for various counties expected to be on the receiving end of American climate migration. The dashboard provides population forecasts under different scenarios, highlights historical indicator performance, and visualizes spatial disparities for applicable indicators. We hope that this dashboard serves as a tool for policymakers, urban planners, and researchers as they grapple with the challenges and opportunities presented by climate-driven migration.
